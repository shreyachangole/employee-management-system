# 👩‍💻 Employee Management System

A simple employee task management web app built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔐 **Login System**:
  - Admin login with a dedicated dashboard.
  - Employee login using individual credentials.

- 📋 **Admin Dashboard**:
  - View a list of employees (5 pre-defined in local storage).
  - Create and assign tasks to any employee.
  - View all tasks and their statuses (Accepted, Completed, Failed).

- 👨‍💼 **Employee Dashboard**:
  - View only tasks assigned to the logged-in employee.
  - Accept tasks, mark them as completed, or fail them.
  - See real-time task status updates and task counts.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The app starts with a login screen.
2. Logging in as Admin allows task assignment.
3. Employees can log in using their own credentials to view & update their tasks.
4. All data is handled using **local storage** (no backend required).
